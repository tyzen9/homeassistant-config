# Special Note
# ------------
# This packackage uses devices that hold generic names because they are
# repurposed for differnent holidays throughout the year. For exapmple, a
# switched outled used to control a Halloween decoration is likley reused at
# Christmas. Please review all automations below to be sure you have the correct
# physical devices associated with the coresponding automation
