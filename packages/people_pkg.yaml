#
# Usage:
#   1. Place this package file in a config/packages folder
#   2. Add this to your configuration.yaml:
#      |homeassistant:
#      |  packages: !include_dir_named packages
#   3. Satisfy all dependant "external" entities (see note/examples below)
#   4. Restart Home Assistant
#   5. Drink a cold beverage
#
# Note: Packages require access to entities that are often configured outside
# of this file.  Manytimes, these are from common integrations such as ESPHome,
# Shelly, Zigbee, etc.  These dependant entities are called out in each package
# declaration below.
#
# Some Examples:
#   - Shelly: https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/shelly/
#   - HAAS.Agent: https://hassagent.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
#   - HACS Alexa Media Player: https://github.com/alandtse/alexa_media_player
