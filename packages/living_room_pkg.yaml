# Author: Steve Theisen (steve@tyzen9.com)
#         www.tyzen9.com  -  github.com/tyzen9
#
# Usage:
#   1. Place this package file in a config/packages folder
#   2. Add this to your configuration.yaml:
#      |homeassistant:
#      |  packages: !include_dir_named packages
#   3. Satisfy all dependant "external" entities (see note/examples below)
#   4. Restart Home Assistant
#   5. Drink a cold beverage
#
# Note: Packages require access to entities that are often configured outside
# of this file.  Manytimes, these are from common integrations such as ESPHome,
# Shelly, Zigbee, etc.  These dependant entities are called out in each package
# declaration below.
#
# Some Examples:
#   - UI Helper: A helper configured in the Home Assistant User Interface
#   - ESPHome: https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/esphome/
#   - Shelly: https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/shelly/
#   - WLED: https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/wled/
#   - Zigbee: https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/zha
